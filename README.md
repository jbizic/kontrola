This project is made of two aplication, like server app and client app. 
Back application have peristance, also is able to make and serve Mysql driven database named Employees, 
with single table employee. For persistance I use Hibernate API with annotations on POJO classis.
Back app have two RESTful service which job is to take requests from client app and operate.
One service is able to save objects to db, and second return it list of object from db in JSON form.

Front app have few pages like form for insert new employees into db, result of this action, and finally 
representations of employee table in list form. 

Front look are made very simple. I skipped to made more complex in interest of time. As it would require for 
me to go on line and research it. If needed I can research, would made like e.g PrimeFaces and implement it. 


I'm here for any suggestion,
best regards,
Jovan
